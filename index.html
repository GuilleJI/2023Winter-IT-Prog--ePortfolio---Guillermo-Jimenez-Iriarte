                <br>
                <p>
                    Hello, my name is <strong>Guillermo Jimenez Iriarte</strong>, and I am a student currently studying <strong>IT Programming at Nova Scotia Community College (NSCC)</strong> . I am passionate about technology and have always been interested in persuing a career in software development. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Throughout my first year at NSCC, I have worked hard to gain knowledge and skills in programming languages like <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, <strong>HTML</strong>, as well as in areas such as software development, database design, and web application development. Moreover, I also learned IT skills such as <strong>Networking and Security</strong> and <strong>Windows 10 operating system</strong>. I have been fortunate to have the opportunity to learn from experienced instructors and to collaborate with my peers on challenging projects. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    While I still have much to learn, I am confident in my abilities and my potential to succeed in this dynamic and ever-evolving industry. I am grateful for the support and guidance I have received thus far and am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Thank you for considering me, and I look forward to continuing to grow and learn as an IT Programmer. 
                </p>
