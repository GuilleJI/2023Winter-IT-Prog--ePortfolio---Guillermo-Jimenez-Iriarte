                    Hello, my name is Guillermo Jimenez Iriarte, and I am a student currently studying IT Programming at Nova Scotia Community College (NSCC). I am passionate about technology and have always been interested in persuing a career in software development. 
                </p>
                <p class="text-small">
                    Throughout my first year at NSCC, I have worked hard to gain knowledge and skills in programming languages like JavaScript, CSS, HTML5, as well as in areas such as software development, database design, and web application development. Moreover, I also learned IT skills such as Networking and Security and Windows 10 operating system. I have been fortunate to have the opportunity to learn from experienced instructors and to collaborate with my peers on challenging projects. 
                </p>
                <p class="text-small">
                    While I still have much to learn, I am confident in my abilities and my potential to succeed in this dynamic and ever-evolving industry. I am grateful for the support and guidance I have received thus far and am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. 
                </p>
                <p class="text-small">
                    Thank you for considering me, and I look forward to continuing to grow and learn as an IT Programmer.
